# Question-3 Instructions


The data for the remaing sets of analyses are from a national telephone interview study of batterer intervention program (BIP) standards advisory and compliance monitoring committees. Respondents were asked a series of questions varying in structure from _open-ended_ to simple _yes-or-no_. These analyses will concern the discrete data collected in response to the following interview questions:

> How many members currently serve on your standards committee?
> Does your organization have methods for assessing programsâ€™ feedback about the standards?
> Do the standards apply to programs designed for all genders?

The primary interest for the below analyses relate to an overarching effort to implement and sustain effective and appropriate anti-violence intervention strategies among female-identified perpetrators of same-sex violence. The above listed questions provide a mix of continuous numeric and dichotomous (`0 = No`; `1 = Yes`) indicators of responding states' current organizational and ideological capacities for such intervention strategies.
