The data for the remaing sets of analyses are from a national telephone interview study of batterer intervention program (BIP) standards advisory and compliance monitoring committees. Respondents were asked a series of questions varying in structure from _open-ended_ to simple _yes-or-no_. These analyses will concern concern the discrete data collected in response to the following interview questions:

> Does your organization have methods for assessing programsâ€™ feedback about the standards?
> Do the standards apply to programs designed for all genders?
> Are there processes in place to revise the standards?
> > Is there a process for informing revisions through program evaluations and needs assessments
> > Is research information utilized in revising the standards?

The primary interest for the below analyses relate to an overarching effort to implement and sustain effective and appropriate anti-violence intervention strategies among female-identified perpetrators of same-sex violence. The above listed questions provide dichotomous (`0 = No`; `1 = Yes`) indicators of responding states' current organizational and ideological capacities for such intervention strategies. 

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
n = 49
ns = 38
Q8y <- 27
pt1 <- R.binom_test(p = Q8y, N = ns, pi0 = 0.5)
```
```{r opts.label='kab'}
kable(pt1, caption = paste0("1-sample proportions test without continuity correction: \\textit{", Q8y, " out of ", n, "}"), col.names = c("$H_{1}$", "$\\pi_{0}$", "$df$", "$p$", "$\\chi_{2}$", "_p-value_", "CI"), format.args = list(digits = 2))
```

# Question-$5$

A Pearson chi-square ($\chi^2$) test was conducted to determine whether there was a significant difference between trafficthe number of states with gender-inclusive BIP standards and those with BIP standards specific only to male-identified perpetrators. Given that no precedent currently exists for gener inclusivity in U.S. states' BIP standards, the binomial test was conducted using $0.5$ as the Null Hypothesis proportion. Of the $`r ns`$ interviewed states with BIP stamdards, `r Q8y` have indicated that their standards are gender-inclusive. The computed difference, $\chi^{2}(1) = `r pt$statistic`$, was larger than the critical value for the two-tailed $1 - df$ test ($3.84$). These findings suggest that a significant difference exists between the number of states with gender-inclusive BIP standards compared with the number of states without gender-inclusive standards.

A Pearson chi-squared test was used to investigate whether states with gender-inclusive standards as compared with states with gender non-inclusive standards were more likely to have revisions processes in place versus not. The difference was significant, $\chi^2(1) = 55.345, p < 0.001$.
